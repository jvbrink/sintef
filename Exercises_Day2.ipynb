    "\n",
    "These exercises are meant for you to practice your Python coding and the concepts you have been shown today. Note that the level of difficulty differs quite a bit, and some of the exercises may be challenging for beginners. Please do not hestitate to collaborate on them, or ask us for advice or help if you get stuck. There are probably too many exercises to cover in the time available, and they have no natural order (except that 4 partly refers to 2), so feel free to do the exercises in the order you prefer."

    "#### Exercise 4: Explore the pandas dataframe format\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise we want to glimpse into the popular pandas dataframe format, which has become the standard tool for data processing applications in Python. A nice feature of pandas is that it is well integrated with notebooks, and data is automatically rendered into nicely formatted and readable tables. We will use the oxford climate data file as an example. Pandas is part of the SciPy package, and is included in the standard anaconda Python installation. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### a) Read the oxford weather data using the pandas `read_csv` function\n",
    "The `read_csv` is the standard for reading files in csv or similar formats, including Excel files and whitespace deliminated files. Use the function to read the oxford weather data into a pandas dataframe object.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint:** Since our file is whitespace deliminated, pass the argument `delim_whitespace = True` to the `read_csv` function. The function also assumes that all rows have an equal number of data items, and therefore gets confused by the first lines. Use the argument `skiprows` to avoid this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### b) Fix the column labels\n",
    "The `read_csv` function will automatically use the first row as the column headers. This is obviously not what we want. We can fix this by passing the argument `header=None` to the function when reading the file, and then manually setting the column headers for the resulting dataframe using the object's `columns` attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### c) Check the datatypes for each column, convert to numerical values if needed\n",
    "You can check the datatypes for each column with the dataframe object's `dtype` attribute. Numerical values are usually automatically stored as int or float, while other values have a generic `object` datatype. We want the year to be an integer and the max temperatures to be a floating point number (`float64`). If needed, data can be converted using the `astype` function, for instance: `df['high'] = df['high'].astype('float64')`.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### d) Plot the max temperature as a function of year\n",
    "Plot the column showing the maximum temperatures as a function of year. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint:** You can either extract the two columns and plot using the usual `plot` function from `matplotlib.pyplot`, or use the built-in plot function of the datafield object, which takes the column labels as arguments. Since we plot the data as-is, without computing the mean value for each year, the plot does not make as much sense as the plot you got in Exercise 2. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### e) Save your dataframe to a hdf file format.\n",
    "Save the dataframe to the hdf file format using the `to_hdf` function of the dataframe object. The function\n",
    "takes a filename and a key as arguments (both strings). Read the file back into a new dataframe using the `read_hdf` function, and verify that the result looks correct. \n"
