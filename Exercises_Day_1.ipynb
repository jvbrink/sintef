    "**1c)** The total mass of the earth is approximately $M=5.972\\times 10^{24}$ kg. Compute the average density of the earth in terms of kg per liter. Does your answer seem reasonable?"

    "\n",
    "**4d)** Use `plt.plot` to plot $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ into the same plot for $x\\in[-5, 5]$. To plot two curves in the same plot, simply do two `plt.plot` commands before you do `plt.show`.\n",
