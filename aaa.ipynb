    "### A Quick Introduction to Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "This document, and most of the others in IN1910, are written in Jupyter notebooks. This is a tool that allows for combining traditional text with code that is executable. Previously known as IPython notebooks, the name was changed to reflect that it works with many different languages. Jupyter notebooks has grown into a popular tool for scientific programming, both for teaching and working. \n",
    "\n",
    "You are not required to become proficient at using or writing notebooks in this course, and you are free to simply read the documents, and do all your own coding in your preferred text editor. However, Jupyter is a nice tool to know, so also feel free to use it to solve exercises and play around with code and concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "In notebooks, everything consists of cells, which are either markdown (text, math, html, etc) or code. In the markdown cells you can render mathematics with LaTeX syntax, and you can include markdown tables, lists, and use html to include images. In the code cells you can write code, and then execute the cell to see the output. You can do this either by clicking the `Run` command in the toolbar on the top, or use the more efficient shortcut `Ctrl+Enter` or `Shift+Enter`. When you run a code, the output will appear below the cell. If you make a change to a cell that has already been run you can rerun the cell, and the new output will replace the old one.\n",
    "\n",
    "One element that might be confusing to those that have not used notebooks before, is that the notebook is one interactive session, and so variables are remembered after running a cell. However, when loading up a notebook for the first time, everything is forgotten, and you will need to run the cells in order again for everything to work properly. Here a helpful tip is to use the `Kernel` > `Restart and Run All` functionality in the toolbar, which will run the whole notebook in order and load everything into memory."

The second statement imports scipy as a package, so now we can use it by writing for example: `scipy.e` The preference for doing this over a wildcard-import is that it keeps the scipy namespace, meaning we (1) don't overwrite anything by accident, and (2) anywhere we use anything from scipy, it will be very apparent from the code.\n",
    "3. The third import is very similar to the second, but we just rename the namespace from numpy to np. This is very common and is just to save some typing later on, as we often use numpy functions quite a lot in our programs. Note that \"np\" is a convention, and you should use exactly that, and not something else. Same for matplotlib.pyplot, which is often shortened to \"plt\".\n",
